Breakdown

    You are probably very familiar with the public_html structure. 
This is the Document Root in which all your public files are accessed (/public_html/page.php is accessed at example.com/page.php).

        img — All your image files. I decided to split content images from layout images.
        css — All your css files.
        js — All your javascript files.

    The resources directory should hold all 3rd party libraries, custom libraries, 
configs and any other code that acts as a resource in your project.
        config.php — Main configuration file. Should store site wide settings.
        library — Central location for all custom and third party libraries.
        templates — Reusable components that make up your layout.
